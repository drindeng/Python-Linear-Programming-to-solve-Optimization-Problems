Linear programming is a set of techniques used in mathematical programming, sometimes called mathematical optimization, to solve systems of linear equations and inequalities while maximizing or minimizing some linear function. Itâ€™s important in fields like scientific computing, economics, technical sciences, manufacturing, transportation, military, management, energy, and so on ([source](https://realpython.com/linear-programming-python/))

In this project, I handled these subjects:

- The three key parts to any linear programming problem
- How to formulate an optimization problem?
- To solve linear programming problems with docplex and Python
